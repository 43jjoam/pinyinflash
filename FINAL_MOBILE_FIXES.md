# 📱 Final Mobile Fixes Summary

## ✅ **All Mobile Issues Fixed**

### **1. Background Movement Fixed** 🎯
**Problem**: Whole page background was moving with card animations
**Solution**: 
- Isolated card animations to `.card-3d` element only
- Added `transform-style: preserve-3d` to card scene
- Ensured background elements stay static during swipe animations

### **2. Card Position & UI Cleanup** 📍
**Problem**: Cards too high, unnecessary text cluttering interface
**Solution**:
- **Removed**: "Tap to flip • Swipe ← for difficult • Swipe → to save" text
- **Repositioned**: Cards now have better vertical centering
- **Increased spacing**: Progress counter moved to `mt-8` for better balance

### **3. Card Back Face Content Fixed** 🃏
**Problem**: Chinese characters and pinyin still visible on card back
**Solution**:
- Added explicit `.card-front` and `.card-back` classes
