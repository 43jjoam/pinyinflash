# üõ†Ô∏è Latest Fixes Summary

## **Issues Fixed** ‚úÖ

### 1. **Card Backface Content Fixed**
- **Issue**: Back of card showed mirrored Chinese and pinyin instead of English, Thai, and emoji
- **Solution**: Added `-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden` to ensure proper backface culling
- **Result**: Back face now correctly shows only English translation, Thai translation, and emoji

### 2. **Tinder-Style Swipe Animation Enhanced**
- **Issue**: Swipe animation wasn't natural like Tinder
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased throw distance: `-200vw` to `200vw`
  - Added upward motion: `translateY(-100px)`
  - Added scaling effect: `scale(0.8)`
  - Increased rotation: `45deg` (was 30deg)
  - Enhanced timing: `0.6s` with smooth easing curve
- **Result**: Cards now fly off screen naturally with realistic physics

### 3. **List Styling Unified**
- **Issue**: Saved/difficult card lists had different styling than main page
- **Solution**: Verified all screens use consistent:
  - Background gradient: `from-purple-600 via-blue-600 to-teal-500`
  - ParallaxBackground component
  - Mobile-friendly button styling
- **Result**: All screens have unified visual design

### 4. **Card Numbers Removed from Lists**
- **Issue**: Lists showed "Card #X" which was unnecessary
- **Solution**: Removed card number display from:
  - `CollectionScreen.js` - removed `Card {index + 1}`
  - `SavedCardsScreen.js` - removed `Card {card.originalIndex + 1}`
  - `DifficultCardsScreen.js` - removed `Card {card.originalIndex + 1}`
- **Result**: Cleaner list view focusing only on Chinese character and English translation
